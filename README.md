## smtp-datetime-libraries
#### Intro to smtplib and datetime library.
I learned how to:
* connect to an email provider's SMTP email server
  * by creating an new SMTP object
* send an email by providing my email address and the recipient's, a password for this app and the message
  * format the message to have a subject and a body
* tap into datetime class method now() and only get a hold of the day of the week, the hour, etc.  

The challenge of the day was to create a program that would read from a quote file and __email me a random motivational quote__ if the day of the week was Monday.
